Mike Selmont is the founder and owner/operator of DOT on Spot, bringing over 10 years of medical experience to mobile DOT physical services. A Rutgers University graduate, Mike recognized the inefficiencies in traditional healthcare delivery and created DOT on Spot to streamline DOT compliance for commercial fleets.

Based in Connecticut, Mike combines his medical expertise with a deep understanding of fleet operations to deliver convenient, on-site DOT physicals that eliminate downtime and waiting rooms. When he's not helping keep drivers healthy and on the road, you can find Mike on the golf course enjoying Connecticut's scenic courses.

Mike's vision for DOT on Spot is simple: professional medical care should fit into your business operations, not disrupt them.
