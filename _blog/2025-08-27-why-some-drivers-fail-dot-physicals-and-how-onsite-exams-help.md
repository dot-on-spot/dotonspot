# **Why Some Drivers Fail DOT Physicals (And How On-Site Exams Help)**

Nearly one in three drivers fail their DOT physicals. This exam is required for every CDL driver to prove they are medically fit to operate safely. For many, failure comes down to preventable issues like high blood pressure, unmanaged health conditions, or lack of preparation.

The good news is that many of these obstacles can be avoided --- and on-site exams make it easier for drivers to succeed.

## **What the DOT Physical Covers**

A certified medical examiner reviews both medical history and current health. The exam checks:

-   **Vision:** At least 20/40 in each eye, corrected or uncorrected.

-   **Hearing:** Ability to hear a forced whisper at five feet or use an approved hearing aid.

-   **Blood Pressure:** Below 140/90 for a two-year card. Higher readings may mean a shorter certification or denial.

-   **Medical Conditions:** Uncontrolled diabetes, untreated sleep apnea, or substance use can disqualify a driver.

-   **Medications:** Some prescriptions may interfere with safe driving and must be reported.

## **Why Drivers Fail**

-   **High Blood Pressure:** Stress, diet, caffeine, and lack of rest all contribute.

-   **Vision Issues:** Uncorrected eyesight problems are common and easily overlooked.

-   **Sleep Apnea:** Untreated, it puts both safety and compliance at risk.

-   **Diabetes:** Poor management or lack of documentation can result in disqualification.

-   **Substance Use:** Drug use or misuse of medication immediately disqualifies a driver.

## **How On-Site Exams Help Drivers Succeed**

Traditional clinic visits often make the process harder: sitting in crowded waiting rooms, stressing over delays, or rushing between appointments can all work against drivers. On-site exams, by contrast, create the best environment for success.

-   **Lower Stress Means Better Results\
    ** Many drivers feel anxious in a clinic. That stress alone can elevate blood pressure readings. On-site exams happen in familiar surroundings --- the yard, terminal, or company location --- where drivers are more relaxed. A calmer setting often leads to more accurate readings and fewer false failures.

-   **Convenience Protects Driver Health\
    ** When exams are brought directly to the workplace, drivers are not wasting hours traveling or sitting in waiting rooms. That extra time can be used to rest, eat properly, or manage health routines --- all of which improve results.

-   **Flexible Scheduling Fits Driver Needs\
    ** On-site exams can be scheduled around rest breaks or shifts, ensuring drivers are not rushing or running late. Being well-rested and properly hydrated makes passing the exam much easier.

-   **Immediate Feedback and Certification\
    ** Drivers get their results and medical card the same day. If an issue is discovered, they can address it right away instead of losing weeks to scheduling delays.

-   **Safer, Cleaner Environment\
    ** On-site exams remove the risk of crowded clinics, reducing exposure to illness that could complicate the exam or sideline a driver.

## **The Bottom Line**

DOT physicals are designed to keep drivers safe and compliant, but the environment matters. Stress, fatigue, and poor timing can all lead to failed results --- even for otherwise qualified drivers. On-site exams remove those barriers, giving drivers a calm, convenient setting that sets them up for success.
