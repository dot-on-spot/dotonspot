# **Understanding Blood Pressure, Vision, and Hearing Requirements for CDL Drivers**

Nearly one in three CDL drivers struggles to meet the health standards required to stay compliant. The most common challenges? Blood pressure, vision, and hearing. These aren't just boxes to check during your DOT physical --- they're essential to staying safe behind the wheel and protecting your career.

This guide explains what the requirements are, why they matter, and what you can do to stay healthy and compliant.

## **Blood Pressure Requirements**

**The Standard:\
** FMCSA requires blood pressure at or below 140/90 mmHg to pass a DOT physical. Higher readings may result in shorter certification periods or, in some cases, disqualification until levels are controlled.

**Why It Matters:\
** High blood pressure (hypertension) raises the risk of heart disease, stroke, and kidney problems. Long hours on the road, limited exercise, and stress can make this a common issue for drivers.

**How to Stay on Track:**

-   Exercise regularly, even short walks or stretches at stops.

-   Limit sodium by cutting back on fast food and processed snacks.

-   See your provider if you're on medication and monitor levels consistently.

## **Vision Requirements**

**The Standard:\
** Drivers must have at least 20/40 vision in each eye (with or without corrective lenses) and a minimum 70-degree field of vision.

**Why It Matters:\
** Clear vision is critical for spotting hazards, reading road signs, and staying safe in all conditions. Even small issues like reduced peripheral vision can affect reaction time.

**How to Stay on Track:**

-   Get regular eye exams to catch issues early.

-   Always wear your prescribed glasses or contacts while driving.

-   Use sunglasses to reduce glare and protect your eyes from UV rays.

## **Hearing Requirements**

**The Standard:\
** Drivers must be able to hear a forced whisper from at least 5 feet away, with or without a hearing aid.

**Why It Matters:\
** Good hearing ensures you can detect sirens, horns, or warnings on the road. Reduced hearing can delay your response time and increase risk.

**How to Stay on Track:**

-   Schedule periodic hearing tests.

-   Protect your ears in noisy environments with earplugs or protective gear.

-   Limit headphone or earbud use, especially at loud volumes.

## **The Role of DOT Physicals**

DOT physicals confirm that drivers meet these health standards. Exams are conducted by certified medical examiners and cover blood pressure, vision, hearing, overall physical health, and medical history. Passing your exam means you're cleared to operate safely --- but staying healthy between exams is just as important.

## **Long-Term Health Management**

Passing once is not enough; CDL drivers need ongoing health management to stay on the road.

-   Keep records of blood pressure readings and medical checkups.

-   Stay up to date with FMCSA guidelines.

-   Focus on prevention: balanced diet, exercise, hydration, and stress management.

## **Final Thoughts**

Blood pressure, vision, and hearing are three of the biggest hurdles CDL drivers face during a DOT physical --- but they're also the most manageable with the right habits. Staying proactive about your health protects your career, keeps you compliant, and ensures the safety of everyone on the road.
