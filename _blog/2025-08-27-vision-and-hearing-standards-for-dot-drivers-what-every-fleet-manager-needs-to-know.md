**Vision and Hearing Standards for DOT Drivers: What Every Fleet Manager Needs to Know**

**Maintaining proper vision and hearing is critical for safe commercial driving. Drivers may pass other aspects of the DOT physical, but failing to meet FMCSA standards for sight or hearing can prevent certification and put your fleet at risk. Understanding these standards helps fleets avoid downtime and ensures regulatory compliance.**

**⸻**

**Vision Requirements**

**FMCSA sets clear minimum standards for vision in commercial drivers:**

**• Visual Acuity: Drivers must have at least 20/40 vision in each eye, with or without corrective lenses.**

**• Field of Vision: A horizontal field of at least 70 degrees in each eye is required.**

**• Color Vision: Drivers must be able to perceive traffic signals and brake lights accurately.**

**• Corrective Lenses: Glasses or contacts are allowed, and drivers should bring them to the exam.**

**Drivers who fail to meet these requirements may need a medical exemption, vision therapy, or corrective procedures to maintain certification.**

**⸻**

**Hearing Requirements**

**Hearing is equally important for safe driving and regulatory compliance:**

**• Standard: Drivers must be able to perceive a forced whispered voice at a distance of at least 5 feet, with or without a hearing aid.**

**• Audiometry Testing: If a driver fails the forced whispered voice test, audiometry testing may be used to objectively measure hearing thresholds at multiple frequencies and determine compliance with FMCSA standards.**

**• Use of Hearing Aids: Drivers may use hearing aids to meet the standard, and they must bring the device to the DOT exam.**

**Hearing deficiencies not corrected by aids may disqualify a driver or require further evaluation by an audiologist.**

**⸻**

**What to Bring to Your DOT Exam for Vision and Hearing**

**To ensure the exam goes smoothly, drivers should bring:**

**• Corrective lenses if they wear glasses or contacts**

**• Hearing aids if they use them**

**Having these items ensures the medical examiner can quickly verify that drivers meet FMCSA standards.**

**⸻**

**Fleet Best Practices**

**Proactive fleets manage vision and hearing compliance by:**

**• Encouraging annual eye exams and hearing checks in addition to DOT requirements**

**• Keeping records of corrective devices and ensuring drivers bring them to exams**

**• Advising drivers to keep glasses with them while driving if they wear contacts**

**• Advising drivers to carry a backup battery for hearing aids**

**• Coordinating with certified medical examiners to avoid delays or failed certifications**

**⸻**

**The Bottom Line**

**Vision and hearing are essential for safe commercial driving. Drivers who fail to meet FMCSA standards risk being sidelined, which can disrupt fleet operations. By understanding the requirements, supporting drivers with corrective devices, and scheduling exams efficiently, fleets can maintain compliance, reduce downtime, and keep drivers safe on the road.**
