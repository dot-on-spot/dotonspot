**Diabetes and DOT Physicals: What Every Fleet and Driver Must Know**

Diabetes is a critical factor in commercial driver safety. The FMCSA recognizes that uncontrolled blood sugar can cause sudden hypoglycemia, vision problems, or other medical emergencies behind the wheel. Understanding diabetes rules is essential to keep drivers compliant and fleets running smoothly.

**Understanding Type 1 vs. Type 2 Diabetes**

FMCSA differentiates between Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes because they present different safety risks and certification requirements.

**Type 1 Diabetes**

• **Insulin-dependent from diagnosis**: The pancreas produces little to no insulin, requiring daily insulin therapy to regulate blood sugar.

• **Higher risk of sudden hypoglycemia**: Insulin therapy can cause rapid drops in blood sugar, which can be dangerous while driving.

• **FMCSA Requirements**: Drivers with Type 1 diabetes must obtain an **insulin waiver** to be certified. Certification depends on demonstrating stable blood sugar control, proper hypoglycemia management, and compliance with medical monitoring.

• **Insulin Waiver Details**: The required form is the **FMCSA Insulin-Treated Diabetes Mellitus (ITDM) Assessment Form, MCSA-5870**. It must be completed by the driver's treating clinician and submitted to the certified medical examiner. Key components include:

• Stable insulin regimen confirmation

• Properly controlled diabetes

• Blood glucose self-monitoring records for at least 3 months

• History of any severe hypoglycemic episodes

• Recent HbA1c measurements (within 3 months)

• Assessment for diabetic complications or target organ damage

• **Certification Length**: Type 1 drivers with an insulin waiver are typically certified for **12 months** if all monitoring and control requirements are met.

**Type 2 Diabetes**

• **Often non-insulin dependent**: The body may still produce insulin, and blood sugar is typically managed with oral medications, non-insulin injectables, or lifestyle changes.

• **Lower immediate risk of sudden hypoglycemia**: However, poorly controlled Type 2 diabetes can lead to long-term complications affecting vision, kidney function, and cardiovascular health.

• **FMCSA Requirements**: Type 2 drivers generally do **not need a waiver** if blood sugar is well-controlled. Medical examiners may request documentation such as HbA1c results, evidence of medication adherence, and a plan for monitoring blood sugar during work hours.

• **Certification Length:** Most medical examiners issue a 1-year certification for type 2 drivers with well-controlled, non-insulin-treated diabetes to ensure regular monitoring of blood sugar control.

**FMCSA Certification Considerations**

• **Insulin Use (Type 1)**: Certification is contingent on an insulin waiver, stable blood sugar control, and hypoglycemia management.

• **Oral or Non-Insulin Therapy (Type 2)**: Drivers can usually be certified without a waiver if blood sugar is stable. Documentation may include recent lab results and physician verification.

• **Safety Checks**: All drivers must meet FMCSA vision standards, as diabetes can affect eyesight. Hypoglycemia education and consistent monitoring are critical.

**Fleet Impact**

For fleets, unmanaged diabetes can result in:

• Unexpected driver downtime due to failed exams

• Administrative burdens tracking waivers and medical documentation

• Safety and liability risks if a driver experiences a medical emergency on the road

**DOT On The Spot Advantage**

DOT On The Spot helps fleets manage diabetic drivers by ensuring exams are completed accurately and efficiently. We:

• Understand all FMCSA diabetes requirements

• Verify documentation and blood sugar control before the exam

• Conduct exams on-site to minimize downtime

• Provide immediate clearance or guidance if additional documentation is required

Our goal is to keep drivers compliant, safe, and on the road, while reducing administrative headaches for fleets.
