**Life's too short for waiting rooms.** After more than a decade in medicine, our founder recognized a fundamental problem: traditional healthcare systems create unnecessary barriers between patients and the care they need. This insight led to the creation of DOT on Spot – a mobile DOT physical service that eliminates waiting rooms and brings professional medical examinations directly to your fleet.

# Our Mission

DOT on Spot exists to streamline DOT compliance while respecting the time and operational needs of commercial fleets.

1. **Eliminate Downtime** - Bring medical services to your location instead of taking drivers off the road
2. **Improve Efficiency** - Replace hours-long clinic visits with convenient on-site examinations
3. **Maintain Excellence** - Deliver the same thorough, FMCSA-compliant care in a more convenient format

## Our Story

Founded by a medical professional with over 10 years of healthcare experience, DOT on Spot was born from frustration with the inefficiencies plaguing traditional medical services. Too many patients – especially commercial drivers – were losing valuable time sitting in waiting rooms for routine examinations that could be conducted more efficiently.

> The best medical care is care that fits into your life, not the other way around.

Recognizing that fleet managers face constant pressure to keep drivers on the road while maintaining compliance, we developed a solution that serves both needs: mobile DOT physicals that come to you.

## What Sets Us Apart

Our approach transforms the DOT physical experience from a time-consuming obligation into a streamlined business process.
