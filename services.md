# Mobile DOT Physical Services That Come to You

Life's too short for waiting rooms. DOT on Spot brings professional, FMCSA-certified medical examinations directly to your facility, eliminating downtime and keeping your drivers on the road where they belong. Our comprehensive mobile services ensure your fleet stays compliant, healthy, and productive.

## Our Core Services

**On-Site DOT Physicals** - Our fully-equipped mobile clinic brings certified medical professionals directly to your location. Complete DOT physicals conducted right at your facility with immediate results and digital documentation.

**Wellness Workshops** - Invest in your drivers' long-term health with educational workshops led by our licensed medical professional. Practical health strategies designed specifically for the unique challenges of commercial driving.

**Free Consultations** - No-obligation consultations to assess your fleet's needs and explore how our mobile services can streamline your compliance process while reducing costs and downtime.

## Why Choose Mobile DOT Services?

Traditional clinic visits cost more than just the examination fee. Factor in driver wages during travel time, vehicle downtime, scheduling complications, and the stress of waiting rooms - the true cost of off-site physicals adds up quickly.

Our mobile approach eliminates these hidden costs while providing the same thorough, FMCSA-compliant examinations in a more convenient, efficient format. Your drivers get their physicals done without leaving your facility, and you maintain full operational control over scheduling and workflow.

**Professional Standards. Convenient Location. Better Results.**
