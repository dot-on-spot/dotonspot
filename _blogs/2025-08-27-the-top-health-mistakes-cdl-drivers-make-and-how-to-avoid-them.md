# **The Top Health Mistakes CDL Drivers Make and How to Avoid Them**

Driving a commercial vehicle is more than a job --- it's a lifestyle. Long hours, tight schedules, and days spent on the road all take a toll on the body and mind. Studies show that nearly 70 percent of CDL drivers are overweight or obese, which increases the risk of serious health issues like diabetes, heart disease, and sleep disorders.

The good news is that many of the most common health problems among drivers are preventable. By being aware of the habits that harm your health and taking small steps to change them, you can improve your well-being, stay alert, and feel better both on and off the road.

## **1. Ignoring Nutrition**

Fast food and convenience store snacks are easy to grab, but they're often loaded with sugar, salt, and unhealthy fats. Over time, poor nutrition leads to obesity, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

**How to Improve:** Pack simple, healthier foods before your trip. Fresh fruit, cut vegetables, lean proteins, and whole-grain wraps are easy to prepare and store. Even swapping out soda for water a few times a day makes a difference.

## **2. Skipping Exercise**

Sitting for long stretches is part of the job, but it shouldn't mean giving up on movement altogether. Lack of activity contributes to back pain, poor circulation, and weight gain.

**How to Improve:** Use breaks as an opportunity to move. Even five minutes of walking, stretching, or bodyweight exercises like squats and push-ups can help reduce stiffness and boost circulation.

## **3. Not Drinking Enough Water**

Dehydration can cause headaches, fatigue, and reduced focus --- all of which make driving more difficult. Many drivers reach for soda or energy drinks instead of water, which often makes the problem worse.

**How to Improve:** Keep a large water bottle in your cab and aim to drink regularly throughout the day. Try to limit energy drinks and sodas since they can cause blood sugar spikes and crashes.

## **4. Delaying DOT Physicals**

DOT physicals are required to make sure drivers are medically fit, yet many drivers wait until the last possible moment to schedule them. That last-minute stress can make an already challenging exam even harder.

**How to Improve:** Plan ahead and schedule your physical before your card expires. Use the appointment as an opportunity to talk about your health and catch issues early instead of treating it as a box to check.

## **5. Poor Sleep Habits**

Irregular schedules, long hauls, and noisy environments make it hard for drivers to get quality rest. Chronic sleep deprivation leads to slower reaction times, poor focus, and increased health risks.

**How to Improve:** Aim for 7--8 hours of sleep whenever possible. Invest in tools like blackout curtains, earplugs, or eye masks to create a better rest environment, even on the road.

## **6. Overlooking Mental Health**

Isolation and long hours can weigh heavily on a driver's mental well-being. Ignoring stress, anxiety, or loneliness only makes the problem worse.

**How to Improve:** Stay connected with family and friends through calls or video chats. Join online groups or communities of other drivers to share experiences. Simple practices like mindfulness or journaling can also help manage stress.

## **7. Skipping Preventative Care**

Many drivers only see a doctor when something goes wrong. This "wait until it's bad" approach means health problems are often caught too late.

**How to Improve:** Schedule regular check-ups and screenings, even if you feel fine. Early detection of issues like high blood pressure or diabetes can make treatment simpler and more effective.

# **Final Thoughts**

Driving a truck comes with unique health challenges, but none of them are impossible to manage. Nutrition, exercise, hydration, sleep, and mental health all play a role in keeping you fit to drive and safe on the road. By recognizing these common mistakes and making small adjustments, drivers can improve both their careers and their lives outside of work.

Good health does not happen overnight, but the choices you make every day add up. Start small, stay consistent, and remember: a healthier driver is always a safer driver.
