**Sleep Apnea and DOT Physicals: What Every Fleet Manager Needs to Know**

Sleep apnea is one of the most common yet underdiagnosed conditions affecting commercial drivers today. While the physical exam itself may take minutes, untreated sleep apnea can have far-reaching consequences for fleet safety, driver alertness, and regulatory compliance.

⸻

**Why Sleep Apnea Matters for Drivers**

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) occurs when a driver's airway collapses or becomes blocked during sleep, leading to interrupted breathing. The result is daytime sleepiness, slower reaction times, and impaired concentration. For commercial drivers, these symptoms translate directly into increased accident risk. FMCSA recognizes untreated moderate-to-severe OSA as a disqualifying condition because of its safety implications.

⸻

**DOT Requirements for Sleep Apnea**

Drivers diagnosed with sleep apnea must demonstrate effective treatment to maintain DOT certification. Key points:

• **Diagnosis:** A confirmed diagnosis of OSA, usually through a sleep study, is required.

• **Treatment:** Most drivers with moderate or severe OSA must use a CPAP (Continuous Positive Airway Pressure) device or an equivalent therapy.

• **Compliance:** Drivers must show consistent CPAP use, at least 4 hours per night on 70 percent of nights over a 30-day period, verified through device reports or a physician.

• **Medical Examiner Role:** The certifying medical examiner evaluates the diagnosis, treatment plan, and compliance. If the driver is symptom-free and compliant, standard certification can be granted. Non-compliance may result in restricted or temporary certification.

⸻

**What to Bring to Your DOT Exam if You Have Sleep Apnea**

To ensure your exam goes smoothly and your certification is processed without delays, drivers only need to bring:

1\. **Documentation of CPAP compliance**, showing at least 4 hours per night on 70 percent of nights over a 30-day period, usually provided by the device or treating physician.

Bringing this document ensures the examiner has the information needed to assess fitness for duty efficiently.

⸻

**Identifying At-Risk Drivers**

Some drivers are more likely to have OSA, including those who:

• Snore loudly or have witnessed apneas

• Experience excessive daytime sleepiness

• Are overweight or have a high BMI

• Have hypertension or other cardiovascular issues

Screening tools like the STOP-BANG questionnaire, combined with medical history and physician evaluation, help identify at-risk drivers before accidents or compliance issues arise.

⸻

**Fleet Best Practices**

Proactive fleets stay ahead by:

• Encouraging routine OSA screening, especially for drivers with known risk factors

• Supporting drivers in obtaining and using CPAP therapy consistently

• Tracking certification and treatment adherence to prevent regulatory lapses

• Coordinating with certified medical examiners for timely, compliant DOT physicals

⸻

**The Bottom Line**

Sleep apnea is more than a medical condition, it is a safety risk and a regulatory hurdle. Untreated OSA can sideline drivers, increase accident risk, and create compliance headaches for fleets. Ensuring drivers are screened, treated, and compliant with CPAP therapy not only keeps fleets safe, but also maintains smooth operations and FMCSA compliance.
