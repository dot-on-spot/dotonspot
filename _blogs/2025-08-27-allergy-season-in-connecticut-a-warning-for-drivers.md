**Allergy Season in Connecticut: A Warning for Drivers**

Spring and fall in Connecticut bring blooming trees, flowers, and high pollen counts. While allergy season affects many, it can be particularly risky for commercial drivers. Sneezing, watery eyes, and congestion may seem minor, but taking certain medications to relieve symptoms, especially those that cause drowsiness, can be dangerous behind the wheel.

**Why Allergy Season Matters for Drivers**

• Allergies can reduce focus and alertness, even without medication.

• Seasonal symptoms may distract drivers, slowing reaction times.

• Many over-the-counter allergy medications, like **Benadryl (diphenhydramine)**, can cause significant drowsiness, impair judgment, and delay reaction time.

**Medications to Watch**

**Drowsy antihistamines**

• Diphenhydramine (Benadryl)

• Chlorpheniramine

• Clemastine

These medications may relieve symptoms quickly but can **impair driving ability**, putting the driver, fleet, and public at risk.

**Non-drowsy alternatives**

• Loratadine (Claritin)

• Fexofenadine (Allegra)

• Cetirizine (Zyrtec, though may cause mild drowsiness in some people)

Drivers should always check labels and consult a healthcare provider if unsure.

**Safety Tips for Drivers**

• Do **not** take Benadryl or any first-generation antihistamine within **12 hours prior to driving**

• Avoid driving if you feel drowsy from any medication

• Choose non-drowsy allergy medications whenever possible

• Schedule breaks if allergy symptoms are severe

• Keep your doctor or pharmacist informed about all medications and supplements

⸻

**Fleet Best Practices**

Fleets can support drivers during allergy season by

• Educating drivers on the risks of drowsy antihistamines

• Providing guidance on safe medication alternatives

• Encouraging open communication about allergy symptoms and medication use

• Planning routes and schedules that allow for breaks during high pollen periods

⸻

**Key Takeaway**

Allergy season in Connecticut may seem routine, but it can affect driver alertness, especially when using drowsy medications like Benadryl. Drivers and fleets should prioritize safety by avoiding first-generation antihistamines within 12 hours of driving, choosing non-drowsy options, and planning ahead to keep everyone on the road safe.
