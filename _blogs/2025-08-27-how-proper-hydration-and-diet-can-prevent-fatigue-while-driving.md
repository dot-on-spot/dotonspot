# **How Proper Hydration and Diet Can Prevent Fatigue While Driving**

Fatigue is one of the biggest risks for drivers. Nearly 30 percent of drivers say they feel drowsy behind the wheel, and drowsy driving has been linked to almost 1 in 10 fatal crashes. Staying alert is not just about getting enough sleep --- what you eat and drink has a major impact on your focus, energy, and reaction time.

With long hours on the road, it's easy to reach for quick fixes like coffee, energy drinks, or fast food. But the smarter approach is much simpler: keep your body fueled with the right foods and stay properly hydrated. Here's how diet and hydration play a key role in preventing fatigue and keeping you sharp on the road.

## **Why Hydration Matters**

Water makes up about 60 percent of the human body, and it's essential for every cell and system to function properly. Even mild dehydration can slow reaction times, affect decision-making, and drain energy --- three things no driver can afford.

**How dehydration affects drivers:**

-   Slower reaction times and poor judgment

-   Muscle fatigue and reduced endurance

-   Irritability or mood swings that make driving stressful

**Daily water goals:**

-   Men: about 3.7 liters (125 ounces)

-   Women: about 2.7 liters (91 ounces)

Your needs may be higher in hot weather or after physical activity.

**Signs you need more water:** dry mouth, dizziness, headaches, dark urine, or feeling sluggish.

## **Staying Hydrated on the Road**

-   **Keep water visible:** A large bottle in the cab is a constant reminder. Aim to sip regularly, not just when you feel thirsty.

-   **Skip the sugar:** Soda and sweet drinks cause energy crashes. Choose water, unsweetened tea, or electrolyte drinks.

-   **Set reminders:** Use alarms or apps to nudge you to drink every hour.

## **The Role of Diet in Fighting Fatigue**

Food is fuel. The type of fuel you put in your body determines whether your energy stays steady or crashes hard. For drivers, steady energy is critical.

**Best foods for lasting energy:**

-   **Complex Carbs:** Whole grains, fruits, and vegetables provide a slow release of energy (think oatmeal, brown rice, sweet potatoes).

-   **Lean Proteins:** Chicken, fish, eggs, beans, or Greek yogurt help repair muscles and keep you full.

-   **Healthy Fats:** Nuts, seeds, and avocado support brain function and long-term energy.

**Foods that drain energy:**

-   Sugary snacks --- quick spike, fast crash.

-   Fast food --- heavy, greasy meals are harder to digest and can make you drowsy.

-   Oversized portions --- big meals before or during a shift can trigger fatigue.

## **Smart Meal Planning for Drivers**

-   **Pack ahead:** Wraps, salads, or pre-made meals save you from relying on gas station food.

-   **Snack smart:** Trail mix, fresh fruit, protein bars, or low-fat yogurt provide quick, nutritious energy.

-   **Use caffeine wisely:** Coffee or tea can help, but avoid overdoing it. Pair caffeine with water to stay hydrated and avoid the crash.

## **Extra Tips to Stay Alert**

1.  **Take breaks:** Get out, stretch, or walk every couple of hours. Movement boosts circulation and focus.

2.  **Breathe deeply:** A few slow breaths can clear your head and fight stress.

3.  **Respect your sleep schedule:** Diet and hydration help, but nothing replaces a solid 7--8 hours of rest.

## **Final Thoughts**

Fatigue is dangerous, but it's preventable. Proper hydration and smart food choices help keep your energy steady, your focus sharp, and your driving safer. For CDL drivers, every small choice --- another glass of water, a healthier snack, a lighter meal --- adds up to better health and safer miles on the road.

Start making those choices today. Stay hydrated, eat for energy, and give yourself the best chance to stay alert behind the wheel.
